REM # Created 7 January 2009
REM #
REM # Modified by Justin Johnson <justin _ honesthacker com> to act as Windows
REM # launcher for the Nailgun server of VimClojure, and to include a check for
REM # a .clojure file in the current directory.
REM #
REM # Environment variables:
REM #
REM # Optional:
REM #
REM #  CLOJURE_EXT  The path to a directory containing (either directly or as
REM #               symbolic links) jar files and/or directories whose paths
REM #               should be in Clojure's classpath. The value of the
REM #               CLASSPATH environment variable for Clojure will be a list
REM #               of these paths followed by the previous value of CLASSPATH
REM #               (if any).
REM #
REM #  CLOJURE_JAVA The command to launch a JVM instance for Clojure
REM #               default: java
REM #               example: /usr/local/bin/java6
REM #
REM #  CLOJURE_OPTS Java options for this JVM instance
REM #               default:
REM #               example:"-Xms32M -Xmx128M -server"
REM #
REM # Configuration files:
REM # 
REM # Optional:
REM #
REM #  .clojure     A file sitting in the directory where you invoke ng-server.
REM #               Each line contains a single path that should be added to the classpath.

# Janus: Vim Distribution

This is a distribution of plug-ins and mappings for Vim, Gvim and
MacVim. It is forked from https://github.com/carlhuda/janus however I am also adding few plugins and modified .vimrc.after
file so that other can use it directly

It is designed to provide minimal working environment using the most
popular plug-ins and the most common mappings.

The distribution is completely customisable using a `~/.vimrc.before`
and `~/.vimrc.after` Vim RC files.



## Customization

For  information on how to customize Janus, you might want to take
a look at the [Customization wiki
page](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/wiki/Customization).
